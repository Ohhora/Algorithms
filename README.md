__Here is my summarization about studing Algorithm theory__</br>
source : Introduction to Algorithms - 3rd Edition(Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein)</br>
I just want to figure out details of algorithms, exactly just summarize, so here is no explanation about specific algorithm.</br>
I'm just beginner and right just a little pseudo-code, if you want more specific code or explanation of algorithm, just read above book :).</br>
